Task 2
Question 5
-Why do I need to find the inside IP addresses? Shouldn't the float IP's be able to work?
-What does it mean by binding the "source"

Them the next hint uses the floating IP to establish the local port forward?

#Remote Port Forward
ssh net3_student1@10.3.0.10 -R 30101:localhost:22 -NT

#Local Port Forward
 ssh net3_student1@10.50.11.222 -L 30102:localhost:30101

 ssh net3_student1@10.50.11.222 -L 30102:localhost:30101

#Bind
ssh net3_student1@localhost -p 30102 -L 30103:10.2.0.2:80

#netstat & grep to verify
netstat -an | grep 30101

Then 

When are ports no longer usable? Like when I create a connection and fire one off but mess something up in the connection, is it still usable?

#check which machine you're on
hostname

Use ip a or ifconfig
ip a | grep inet
