Task 2
Question 5
-Why do I need to find the inside IP addresses? Shouldn't the float IP's be able to work?
-What does it mean by binding the "source"

Them the next hint uses the floating IP to establish the local port forward?

#Remote Port Forward
ssh net3_student1@10.3.0.10 -R 30101:localhost:22 -NT

#Local Port Forward
 ssh net3_student1@10.50.11.222 -L 30102:localhost:30101

 ssh net3_student1@10.50.11.222 -L 30102:localhost:30101

#Bind
ssh net3_student1@localhost -p 30102 -L 30103:10.2.0.2:80

#netstat & grep to verify
netstat -an | grep 30101

Then 

When are ports no longer usable? Like when I create a connection and fire one off but mess something up in the connection, is it still usable?

#check which machine you're on
hostname

Use ip a or ifconfig
ip a | grep inet

Tunnel Activity 1 -Avatar


Tried to ssh and did not work because of no username
run scan on internal network to see port 80 is open
used wget to get name of Sokka

#interrogate ports
#perform full enumeration
#when you scan ports, access every port

proxychains ./scan.sh
proxychains wget -r http://172.16.40.10
proxychains wget -r ftp://72.16.40.10

Then ssh to the box

Once on the box, enumrate to get info
we did ifconf to get internal ip

because we are on the box, we must used internal IP

back to internet_host to create dynamic port

ssh Sokka@10.50.176.142 -D 9050

then run proxychains on internal ip

>IH proxychains ./tcp_scans

we need a tunnel to put wget on our local machine
>IH ssh Sokka@10.50.176.142 -L 1111:l92.168.1.39:22 -NT
